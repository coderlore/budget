Budget Calculator

The budget calculator takes the user's income and subtracts it from the listed expense. There is an overall budget (in the top left corner) that shows how much money the user has left over, as well as a chart for the user to visualize their income versus expense. There is a dashboard for the user to designate if an item is either an expense or income with an amount. The user can toggle in the 'expense', 'income', or 'all' lists. For the 'expense' and 'income' lists, the user has the option to edit or delete an item. For the 'all' list, the user has the option to delete an item.
